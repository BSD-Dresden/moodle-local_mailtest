Description
-----------
The Moodle MailTest module allows administrators to test Moodle's email
system. A trace of the SMTP dialogue will be displayed if the email message
cannot be sent for any reason.

Once the test email has been sent, you will need to check your email inbox
to confirm that the email message was successfully delivered. This plugin
will not do that for you.

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires Moodle 2.5+ from http://moodle.org

Changes
-------
2015-11-01 - Initial version.

Installation
------------
Install the plugin, like any other plugin, to the following folder:
/local/cms

See http://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Installing_plugins for details
on installing Moodle plugins.

Unininstallation
----------------
Uninstalling the plugin by going into the following:

Home > Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Manage plugins

...and click Uninstall. You may also need to delete the following folder:

    /local/mailtest

Usage & Settings
----------------
The local_mailtest plugin is designed allow administrators to test Moodle
to ensure the email message system is correctly configured.

There are no settings for this plugin.

Once installed, login as an administrator and then click:

    Home > Site Administration > Server > Mail Test

Enter the email address of the recipient where you want to send the message
and click the [Send a test message] button.

If the email message was successfully sent by Moodle, you will see a message
that says "Success - The test message was successfully delivered to the SMTP
server.". If it fails to send the email, a dialogue between the Moodle and
the SMTP server will be displayed.

Security considerations

This plugin allows administrators to submit an email through a web form which
is restricted to logged in Moodle administrators only.

forums and is supported by TNG Consulting Inc.
